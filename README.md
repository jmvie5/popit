My spouse bought a small game for my youngest child called Pop It.

I wanted to make it in Python for fun, enjoy playing Pop It in your terminal!

I searched the internet and did not find the "real" rules for this game, so here are the ones we use:

#### RULES

1. The last player to pop a bubble loses the game
2. You can't pop more than 3 bubbles in one turn
3. You can't pop all the bubbles in an empty row
#
P.S. If you play the bot, the difficulty is the number of half moves it can see in advance (depth of the minimax algo).
